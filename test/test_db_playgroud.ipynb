      "Surface reconstruction aims at generating continuous surfaces from discrete point clouds. It is a\n",
      "fundamental and challenging task in current robotics and vision applications [1, 2, 3]. Recently,\n",
      "deep learning-based implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for this\n",
      "task, such as signed distance fields (SDFs) [4, 5], unsigned distance fields (UDFs) [6, 7, 8], and\n",
      "neural vector fields (NVF) [9]. INRs benefit from its continuity, and the ability to handle complicated\n",
      "topology, showing promising performance on surface reconstruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although current INRs-based methods have achieved promising performance in reconstructing\n",
      "surfaces, they suffer from two main challenges. First, most methods [9, 10, 11] deal with the distinct\n",
      "local regions as geometry elements to estimate the query point values, e.g., signed/unsigned distance.\n",
      "However, different local regions may exhibit different poses but with similar intrinsic geometry. The\n",
      "extrinsic poses of these 3D patches prevent the models from capturing the intrinsic geometry of\n",
      "3D shape patches. Second, INRs [5, 6, 7, 9, 12] without considering equivalence commonly learn\n",
      "the representation of the points using a fixed coordinate frame, implying that if the input points are\n",
      "rotated, the original coordinate mapping may no longer accurately predict the desired output, leading\n",
      "to distortions or inaccuracies. These properties of INRs hinder their applicability to complex 3D\n",
      "scenarios, in particular with regard to their cross-domain generalization ability and robustness to\n",
      "arbitrary transformations like rotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To tackle these challenges, we try to eliminate the redundant factor of poses and more focus on\n",
      "the learning of the intrinsic geometric representation of local regions, yielding a patch-level pose-\n",

      "\finvariant representation (PPIR) of 3D objects. Based on this representation, we develop a patch-level\n",
      "equivariant implicit function (PEIF), allowing us to achieve the equivariance patch-wisely while\n",
      "effectively encoding arbitrary topology. Specifically, in the PEIF framework, the query/patch pairs\n",
      "are first normalized via a unique pose normalization. Then the query/patch features are extracted\n",
      "and processed via learnable multi-head memory banks to acquire the intrinsic patch geometry\n",
      "representation, which is aggregated with the spatial relation representation, resulting in the patch-\n",
      "level pose-invariant representation. PPIR is then utilized for displacement prediction, which can be\n",
      "proven to be equivariant for SE(3) transformations. These designs enhance the expressive power of\n",
      "INRs with PPIR and enable the PEIF to flexibly adapt to 3D domain gaps as well as arbitrary SE(3)\n",

      "\n",
      "In this work, we propose a patch-level equivariant implicit function, based on the patch-level\n",
      "pose invariant feature representation over the pose-normalized query points and corresponding\n",
      "neighboring patches. The proposed representation achieves promising results in 3D reconstruction\n",
      "both quantitatively and qualitatively, and generates shapes with better geometry details and robustness\n",
      "to SE(3) transforms. Due to the flexibility of the patch-based representation, in the future, we plan\n",
      "to extend this approach to larger-scale 3D reconstruction of real scans. Additionally, our patch-based\n",
      "pose invariant representation can be taken as a foundation network for pre-training, followed by\n",
      "fine-tuning on few-shot examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitation. As an implicit network, one limitation is that PEIF relies on the query points and\n",
      "estimating the displacement point-wisely. For scaling up to a larger scale, we plan to utilize a\n",
      "multi-scale technique and importance sampling of query points for efficient displacement field\n",
      "estimation.\n",
